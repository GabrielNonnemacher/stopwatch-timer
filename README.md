### The timer and stopwatch project is very simple and didactic. The intention of this project is to serve as inspiration for more people, to further consolidate my portfolio and also to cover new knowledge and tools for me.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionalities

As features we have:
* Select between the two options (*Timer or Stopwatch*);
  * **Timer**: By selecting the Timer, the user can determine how long until he wants to be notified.
  * **Stopwatch**: By selecting the Stopwatch, the user can determine how long the start and end of an event took place.
* Select between the two options (*Light Mode or Dark Mode*); 
  * **Light Mode**: When selecting the Light Mode, the user has a visualization mode with lighter colors.
